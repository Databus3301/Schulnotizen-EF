Hello Lucy, 

I'm writing this e-mail in response to you requesting the info about that article "Jeder Vierte in der Generation Z schämt sich fürs Fliegen" - every fourth person of Gen-Z feels guilty for using airplanes - 

The article mediated briefly goes as follows:

Greta Thunberg first popularized the term 'Flygskam', a guilt felt for flying, and while many people still use airplanes their usage has gone back in the millenial generation and even more in Gen-Z.

Gen-Z is becoming ever more aware of their effect on climate change, and while the topic of sustainability is going up in popularity throughout all generations, the so called Greta-Effect, in it's curent size,  doesn't really affect the airplane companies in terms of revenue yet.

I hope I could help and would love to hear back from you soon.
