#### Writing an Analysis -  Characterization of Quinn
Quinn is the white main protagonist of the 2015 young adult novel "All American Boys" written by Jason Reynolds and Brendam Kiely, with an interest in basketball.

The story plays out in Springfield, USA, taking place at the Springfield Highschool in large.

The plot of half the novel revolves around Quinn being witness to the black boy Rashad being victim of police brutality and how Quinn deals with his thoughts through self reflection and taking action.

In the given extract Quinn finds himself at basketball practice, his thoughts split between the incident he witnessed and performing well in basketball practice to impress the currently active scouts.

Quinn is a 17 year old (see p.31 ll. 22f) Sprinfield High student (see p. 58. ll.4f).

He is pretty sporty with an interest in basketball (see p. 140 ll. 19f)

His close family and relationship consist of his brother Willy (see p. 30 ll. 15), who he's pretty close to (see p. 33 ll.18f), his mother (see p. 33 ll.20f) aswell as the Cambis family (see p. 30 l. 6).

Quinn's dad died fighting in Afghanistan (see. p. 32 ll. 9f), so his mother expects him to take responsibilty now (see p. 30 ll. 11f).

Quinn's thoughts conflict between wanting to be noticed by the scouts and shutting out his thoughts about the incident (see p. 140 ll. 22-25) aswell as   on how to act, having been really close to Paul for the majority of his life (see p. 140 ll. 7-10) but also acknowledging  that what Paul did, wasn't good, searching for explanations (see p. 140 ll. 11-14).

To conclude, Quinn henceby isn't just one of the main protagonist of the novel, he is the white main protagonist, experiencing racism manifesting right in front of him to such a degree for the first time in his life, he doesn't just have an interest in basketball, but an interest in justice and self development all mixing, when he is training.
