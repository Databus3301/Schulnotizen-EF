#### Your article of  28th August 2008 "Junk raft complete voyage to Hawaii"

Sir or Madame,

I read your article with great interest and would like to comment on your closing statement "Knowing what I know, it would be inmoral to do nothing."
You are absolutely right when it comes to the core of your statement however I think it or perhaps you might be mistaken when it comes to responsibility and power in terms of impacting ocean pollution. 
I agree with you on the importance of raising awareness about the serious effects of even present climate change, but I personally believe that you can't label every non-activist immoral as there literaly is no ethical consumption under capitalism, with the real climate culprits being mega corporations that have the power to change things. 
Hence I come to the same conclusion as you, but would distinguish between impactul action, i.e. raising awareness and lesser so impactful action, i.e. drinking tab water instead of bottled water, which still resembles an important step towards a more climate neutral existence of the human species, but arguably can't stem the weight the literall tons of plastic produced by the hands of global players.
To conclude the statement in my humble opionion is valid just unspecific.

Sincerely,
Felix Rose
