# Dialogue - Quinn Rashad
#### It's after practice
**Quinn**: yk it's kinda weird
**English**: what?
**Quinn**: Coach, Rashad, practice
**English**: go on
**Quinn**: It just doesn't seem right.
**Quinn**: Rashad completetly unrightfully falling victim to police brutality and we just supposed to keep shut about it.
**English**: I suppose. The scouts don't care tho.
**Quinn**: So you don't care?
**English**: yk I'm torn up myself. While this is a clear case of racism caused police brutality, which by no means is justifiable or tolerable, this sadly isn't a new thing. POC are falling victim to widespread racism all over America and no1 talking about it doesn't better that by any means, but talking about it with the scouts certainly wont get you anywhere either.
**Quinn**: huh, you really think the incident happened at fault of racism?
**English**: Look, it might not be easy for you as a priviledged white male in an All-American culture to notice but this is a thing. And it's been going on for a while. I experienced it before, Rashad experienced it before and my parents certainly experienced it before. I'm by no means supportive of that, heck, that'd be hypocritical. And while I'm no where near as priviledged as you, I can comfortably make this decision of focusing on something else for once in my live. 
**Quinn**: I- that was really eye opening, thank you
**Quinn**: But are you saying that I should support coach in this, leaving everything at the door or that that would just be taking advantage of my privileges 
**English**: I can't make that decision for you. But I think it is important to remember what caused this incident to happen. Even in basketball practice. It might not be the best place or time to raise awareness of that issue, but remembering is way more helpful than ignoring it like the rest of the traditionalist  straight cis white single family suburban households. But outside of this relevant of trainings merely remembering certainly wont put a stop to this either.
