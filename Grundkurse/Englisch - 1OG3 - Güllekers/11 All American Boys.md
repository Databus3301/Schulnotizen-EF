#### Characterization of Rashad
Rashad is the black main protagonist in the 2015 young adult novel "All American Boys" written by Jason Reynolds and Brandon Kiely, with an interest in art.

The story is set in Springfield - USA, playing at the Springfield Highschool in large

The plot of the entire novel revolves around Rashad being victim of police brutality, wherin Rashad's case serves as a channel to bring attention to the bigger topic, also giving first hand impressions of what it means to be involved in such a case.

Rashad is a black (p.16. l.9) eleventh grade (p.23 l.15) Springfield High (p.18 l.24)  student, usually wearing a T-shirt with sneakers and "sagged down" (p.23 l.10f) jeans (p. 23 ll. 9ff) or an ROTC uniform on Fridays (p. 15 l. 16).

His close family consist of his father, David  (p. 17 l. 26) Butler (p. 53 l.19), who served in the army and as a police officer (p.16 ll.22f), his mother, Jessica Butler (p. 53 l.19), and his brother Randolph, "Spoony" (p. 53 l. 21), Butler (p. 53. l. 21).

Rashad has an interest partying (p.10, ll.15f) and art (p. 21 ll. 31f), spending a lot of time drawing (p.17 ll.30f).

As a black person his english deviates from britisch englisch, speaking the dialect of AAVE (p. 15 l.10).

All in all it is plausible to say that Rashad's life very well is influenced by racism be it indirect or direct.
