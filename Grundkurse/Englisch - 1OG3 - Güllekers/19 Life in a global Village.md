- industrial countries
	- countries that at one point started to outsource work to mashines and low wage workers in factories with stadartized ways of manufacturing in an attempt to maximize monetary gain in a capitalist society,* which massively profited from the process enabling them much of their technological  and quality of life standarts, while paying the price in enviromental impact, now all suddenly concerned with keeping developing countries from embarking on the process of becoming industrial countries themselves  under the woo of climate change, as to not have to deal with competition,  punishing those same developing countries already suffering from the prolonged ignorance regarding enviromental impact during the developed countries industrial high.*
