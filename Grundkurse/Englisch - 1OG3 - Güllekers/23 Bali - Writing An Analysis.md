# Bali - Writing An Analysis

#### Name it, Prove it, Explain it
Name it | Prove it | Explain it
:-:|:-:|:-:
"picturesque … (rice) paddies … postcard pretty" → Allitaration | ll. 5f | Emphasises Bali's true beauty and simultaniously connects it to the dying farming culture
"Before we didn't have a problem with water … but now … we have problems. Sometimes we have enough, sometimes we don't" → Parrallelism, Antithesis | ll. 12f | Divides Bali's past self further from it's present state and thereny emphasizes that there is a problem 

#### Analysis
Jed Smith uses rhetorical devices and quotes in his article  "Bali's Tourism is Sucking the Island Dry" to emphasize the threat tourism poses to Bali's ecosystem.

He introduces the problem with a reminiscent local, providing ground for empathy and showing that the insland indeed changed (cf. ll. 1-5), the repetition of the letter 'p' in  "picturesque resort \[…\], rice paddies \[…\] postcard-pretty views" (ll. 3-5) emphasizes Bali's beauty and simultaniously connects its dwindeling to the locals and their now old farming life.
This change in lifestyle is then directly pointed out through the quote in line four and makes tourism to blame, while still providing ground for empathy.
The antithesis "Before we didn't have a problem with water \[…\] but now \[…\] we have problems. Sometimes we have enough, sometimes we don't" (ll. 12f) further divides the old and simple, farming Bali from the new and suffering tourist Bali.
