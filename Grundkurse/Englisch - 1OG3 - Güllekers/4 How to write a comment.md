#### Commenting on [[4 How to write a comment#Cutting language classses|â†’]]
The school plans to cut language classes in favor of more important subjects. 
I'm here to argue against this decision and proof that languages, especially english, are in fact some of the utter most important subjects to be taught at all, if not absolutely vital for living life to the fullest.

The argument of lessening the learning stress on students made a constant reappearance in this blog, and while I'm not here to debunk this, the plethora of benefits, later touched on, coming with learning a language such as english, highly outweigh the stress reduction in ones later life compared to this incentive.
The ability to focus on other things, further plays into the first argument, and hence can be defeated in a similar way, as the time spend, in what should be a comparibly low stress enviroment, will repay later.

Now to the myriad of advantages coming with learning languages outperforming the counterarguments.
First of all if you have a general interest in languages, learning them gets easier over time, as you discover the many similarities in between them. But even if you don't plan to learn an exessive amount of languages, learning an additional language, comes with the ability to pick up countless similar words from other languages.

Alongside of missing out on student exchanges, your access to culture in that language will be highly limited, be it missing out on literature in it's original form, music, festivities, food or even just meeting people. All of which can be eye opening and personality building.

But argueably most important of all you'll miss out on many job oportunities, as globalisation has progressed to a point where it's almost a requirement, less than a mere advantage, to speak multiple languages in a lot of jobs, with further globalisation only imminent.

This among other discussion in this thread, leads me to conclude that while cutting down on language classes may decrease stress and pressure on students for now, it would come back around to them in the long term, as one might consider at least some of the above arguments as vital for living life to the fullest.
