# "talking" about your a gap year
#### Writing a blog entry
Taking a gap year only has become all the more popular as time progressed and as many of you will be faced with the decision to take a gap year at some point in your life this blogpost will reflect on the concept and it's worth, answering the question "which opportunity is the best?".

You all probably heard that taking a gap year can be a wonderful way to improve your social skills, self-development, financials or just to experience something new. And that a gap year will look good on your resume and improve your employability pretty much regardless of your choice of gap year plan.

That being said, taking a gap year is still a pretty privileged choice to make depending on your selection and realising your dreams wont always be easy, if you don't have the required resources, but through volunteer work or smiliar gap year opportunities, that don't require large amounts of money upfront, you can still profit from the incredibly rewarding experience that is taking a gap year.

Now if you are thinking or perhaps thought about taking a gap year, and might be confused as to what opportunity suits you best, if you are anything like me your best bet will be travelling all throughout europe with a eurorail-pass, this is just one of the many ways you can travel the world for cheap and in combination with a european passport this pass allows you to board all high speed trains in europe and travel to countries in the schengen zone without even having your passport checked.  Depending on how you plan your travel you can start to travel the world for less than a euro by utilizing ridesharing, street performing, couch surfing and pair cooking to cover transportation, housing, food and other needs. Meanwhile you get a ton of one of a kind impressions, self-development, social-skills and unforgettable experiences in return.
