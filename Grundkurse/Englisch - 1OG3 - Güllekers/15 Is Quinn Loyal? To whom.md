# Is Quinn Loyal? To whom?
#### Expectations of Quinn
- **Guzzo** expects him to keep shut, on the basis of preservering a long lasting friendship
- **Coach** expects him to not talk about it while training to not sparl any conflicts in the team
- **Rashad** doesn't know him yet, but would probably expect him to testify
- **Mother** 
- **Paul** expects him to support him and keep shut just as Quinn
- **Jil** seemed shook about Quinn not doing anything about the incident while it was going down, so she'll probably want him to make up for that by protesting / testifying aswell
#### Loyalty definition
> Standing by the people and the things you love, even in the darkest times because you're willing to brave the dark [shadows](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shadows) and the monsters in darkness, and even in the greatest of times, because you're not afraid to let them shine with an [intensity](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=intensity) so bright, it scorches the ground they [walk on](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=walk%20on).
#### Dialogue

- **quinn:** Hey bud, what up
- **mé:**, nothing wbu?
- **quinn:** nothing either, but there's actually something I wanted to talk to you about
- **mé:** spill it m8
- **quinn:** so we all heard about the incident at Jerry's by now
- **mé:** yea
- **quinn:** at it's just been bothering me yk?
- **mé:** how come? if you wanna rant I'll listen buddy
- **quinn:** thanks, see I've actuallly been a bystander in the crowd from the video, ,,,so I witnessed it first hand, I was there. I could have stopped it. And all I did was watch. Watch like watching a clown in circus. It feels so wrong. I feel wrong.
- **mé:** I hear you, Rhat must be a horrible feeling. Feeling like being guilty, while having done nothing, or rather bc doing nothing. But I can assure you, in such an intense situation, it's only natural to be paralyzed by shock. None of the other bystanders did anything either. And I'm sure that some of them feel just like you now. Have you considered testifying to the police, or telling rashad about your point of view?
- **quinn:** no
- **mé:** Hey man, it's not your fault, what happened on that day. But instead of feeling guilty, you can do something now
