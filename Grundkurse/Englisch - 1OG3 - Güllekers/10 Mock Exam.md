#### Summary
Ossob Mohamud's 2015 blogpost "Beware the 'Voluntourist' Doing Good" published on the website africanontheblog.com, covers her experience and concerns regarding voluntourism.

Ossob Mohamud made her first experiences with voluntourism in a college Alternative Spring Break program, wherein the university organised trips to disadvantaged or poverty-stricken communities. 

Her critique now lies within the vastly different socio-economic statuses and level of privilege experienced by the travellers in relation to the locals and their absence of knowledge about the locals' history, culture and ways of life.

As a result Ossob Mohamud felt ashamed at the exessive praise from the locals' for something she could not take full credit for as many of the buildings they finished were already near completion, with them rather slowing down the process than helping out.

Her problem with voluntourism thereby spreads to the unjust reward, be it on one's resume or through the self-approval. Aswell as the question of the effectiveness and sustainability of the work.
