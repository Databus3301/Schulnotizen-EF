> English is the only language needed - as already everyone speaks English, we do not need any other languages in the world

#### "English is the only language needed"
"English is the only language needed", has grown to be a more common opinion alongside the rise of globalisation. However forcing english on everybody wouldn't work, and even if it would be of no good.

English isn't perfect on many levels, no language is, but that's precisely the reason why abolition of all languages is a bad idea, with unique semantics exclusive to some languages, abolition would just lead to a loss of overall ways to communicate.

It may seem like worldwide communication should increase on the abolition of all languages expect english, but apart from the fact that there already are many region specific dialects, that even now dont neccessarily allow for flawless communication from different english speaking people and would only grow in number with worldwide english adoption, english already is the standart in some of the most important fields, such as science and trade.

And even ignoring the extreme diffuculty that would come with establishing english among different generations of people and the culture connected to them, no one language is perfect for every use case. English might have pretty easy to understand grammar and a broad usage as complex language in fields of research, but it doesnt exel at any of those two, like other languages could and henceby is merely a mediocre solution for a bigger problem.

To conclude english might be a well established language among a wide range of use cases, and is undeniably a lingua franca, but it's merely the standart in science, and buisiness because of the sheer amount of culture, practicallity, and people attached to the countless other languages and that is ok.
