# Volunteer Work Abroad EVA
#### Dialogue
A: It's easy to fall into a trap, when volunteering, be it being exploited under surreal working conditions, exploiting locals by taking their jobs, or making others feel exploited by living out the quick pace livestyle and abandoning new 'friends' after a week of work. Besides there are enough problems back here in Germany that need fixing, shouldn't we focus on ourselves first before helping others?

B: While I agree on many of your arguments, most of these traps can be avoided by properly doing your research, to find a moral corporation having the side effect that you probably wouldn't even be able to live the damaging short pace travel livestyle as they know very well about these concerns. And while it is true that many things here in Germany are still very wrong and there's lots of work to be done also through volunteer work, we as a nation are way further than many developing countries one often might end up in volunteering abroad.

C: What a great dialogue

#### comment on [[8 Volunteer Work Abroad EVA#most of evil in this world is done by people with good intentions|→]]
Essayist T. S. Eliot once said: "Most of the evil in this world is done by people with good intentions", a comment whose value is decided purely by perspective although one might find it very convincing at first.

If a cannibal buys a person consensually selling their body to be eaten online, meets and eats the person to satisfy their abandonment issues than that happened under a good intention from the perspective of the cannibal and possibly even the person eaten. This way of argumenting can be applied to many such cases and will work most of the time.

However while this might sound plausible at first, there really is a deeper meaning to this as one might very well debate at whatever point of morale, external influence, or disillusionment an intention can truly be good and if the same person would hold the same values without such influence.

To conclude one might take away that while the quote seems hold an obvious truth it's meaning is really is debatable if looked into further and maybe even plain wrong as a result, it's a matter of perspective ;).
