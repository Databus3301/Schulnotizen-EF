# Describing a cartoon
The 2002 Seppo Leinonen cartoon published on seppo.net, deals with the problem of plastic pollution and it's wanna be solutions.

The center-right of the presented room is made up of a hospital bed, with sheet of graph paper at it's front, and an anthropromorphized earth as it's patient lieing in it, smiling and saying 'I fell better already!' looking to the left, where two doctors dressed in coats are standing next to eachother behind the bed looking at the earth, both holding a list with the right one saying 'We are now using reusable drapes and gowns' and the left one smiling.
The doctor's text is printed larger and above the earth's.

The visual makes an ironic comment on the seemingly productive solutions to earths problem of plastic pollution and consumerism, by presenting the action of reusing drapes and gowns as an immediate solution to the bigger problem. The green hat of the talking doctor matches with the colour of earths landmasses, while the blue hatted doctor doesn't talk at all, representative of how we only care of getting rid of plastic from our immediate sight, with short term symbolic solutions such as the presented one while leaving the oceans to suffer. The conveyed message thereby consists of a critique on current politics and non-effective efforts to save the planet.
